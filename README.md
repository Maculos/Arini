## Project State

This project is currently a work in progress and no code or documents should be considered finished or functional.

## Current Project Objectives

I'm attempting to create a tetris demo to prove that this works but after that the priority order is:

* Create adapter boards
* Create basic web interface
* Add a few more games such as Wave Race or Dr. Mario
* Fork existing gameboy printer emulator and add it as a module
* Send multiboot roms
* Capture multiboot roms

### Systems I have to test against

* 2X GBA
* 1X DMG or HW Revision (Need 2 for testing)

### Hardware needed to fully test against

* Gameboy Printer
* 1 more DMG or HW Revision
* Gameboy Camera

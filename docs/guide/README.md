# Style Guide

The template file is setup to allow you to quickly prepare a doc and drop in most data.
If you need to *signifigantly* change the template simply leave a reason in your PR but small changes are perfectly fine.

File structure is as follows:
docs/Game Name (Release Year) (Game ID from thegamesdb.net)/gamename.docx

View the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file and ensure it meets the guide before opening a PR.
